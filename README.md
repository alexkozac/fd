# Random Word Generator with Translation

This program generates a specified number of random words and translates them into the desired language using the Google Translate API. The words were randomly selected during a walk around the city, adding a touch of serendipity to the translations. You can customize the number of words and the target language by modifying the variables in the `translate.py` file.
